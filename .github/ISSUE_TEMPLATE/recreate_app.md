The app essentially builds a 10 question quiz of multiple choice questions using questions from the [Questions.json](https://github.com/Tc2r1/Hacktoberfest_Interview_App/blob/master/Languages/Android/questions.json) and Answers from the [Answers.json](https://github.com/Tc2r1/Hacktoberfest_Interview_App/blob/master/Languages/Android/answers.json). A Question item / model/ response has a "shortAns" key which is mixed in with 3 keys from the "Answers.json" to create a multiple choice question. Upon the user selecting the correct answer they move to the next question. 

No matter which answer a user selects, they are shown a "Details" view that tells them more about the "answer" they selected. 

After answering 10 questions they are taken to a score view where they can see how well they did, and try again.
