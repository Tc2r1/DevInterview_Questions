## This is the root folder you should open with IDE to build the android application

Inside this folder are modules written in Java or Kotlin that all showcase different libraries (hilt, retrofit, coroutines), patterns (mvp, mvvm, view models, DI), and techniques to build an application that takes a set of questions and answers from an api request and uses them to make a functioning quiz that users can use to study for their development!

### üéÉüéÉ LEVEL 3 CONTRIBUTIONS üéÉüéÉ

Level Three Contributions are definately our favorite to see. Here you will create a module of your own within the project and showcase your skills at recreating the Quiz App using unique library combinations. You should focus on showing off a few different libraries and an architecture of your choice (MVP, MVC, MVVM, HILT, Coroutines, etc etc etc endless possibilities).

Please focus on and gain experience with the repository layer, dependency injection, view
models, and whatever else you like!

There are plenty of "Issues" for this type of contribution, though you may have to scroll through the issues page to find them. It is fine if you create one of these without an issue ticket.

Here are steps to complete this type of contribution:

1. navigate to `https://github.com/Tc2r1/DevInterview_Questions/tree/master/Interview_Prep_App/`
2. decide if you want to work in Native_Java or Native_Kotlin, or something else (for something else skip to 6b) open the folder you choose.
3. Fork the repo and create a branch to save your work to.
4. copy the template application folder, paste it into native_kotlin folder, and rename it based on what your project will showcase. for example "retrofit, coroutines, viewmodel, jetpack
   compose" along with your username (IE:
   retrofit2_tc2r1)

5. Open the "Interview_Prep_App" folder in android studio and add your module to the settings.gradle file.
6. Rename the module id com.interviewprep.unique_folder_name_from_step_3 6b. For those who want to work in something besides native android, create a
   folder with your application type in `Interview_Prep_App` folder: "SwiftUI" "Html5" etc.
