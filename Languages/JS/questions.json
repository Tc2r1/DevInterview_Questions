	"question": "What is a callback?",
	"details": "In javascript, functions are treated as first-class citizens, they can be used as an argument of another function, can be returned by another function and can be used as a property of an object.",
	"questionType": "multi",
	"trueOrFalse": false,
	"shortAns": "It is a function that will be executed after another function gets executed.",
	"tag": "JavaScript"
	},
	{
	"id": 1,
	"question": "What is a Promise?",
	"details": "In javascript, Promises are objects that can be in 1 of 3 states - pending, fullfilled or rejected. The condition or state can then be used to control a callback function",
	"questionType": "multi",
	"trueOrFalse": false,
	"shortAns": "It is an object that can be in 1 of 3 states depending on the condition of the code",

	"id": 2,
 	"question": "What is the  == and === in JavaScript?",
 	"details": "Loose equality (==) and Strict equality (===) are two ways of checking the equality in JavaScript. Double equlity (==) only check the value of data rather than the data type whereas strict equality (===) checks for both value of data and datatype of data as well. Inherently type coercion is being performed in double equality so data type cannot be identifed as distinct.",
 	"questionType": "multi",
        "trueOrFalse": false,
        "shortAns": "It is a way of checking equality in JavaScript. Both have their use cases in different situations.",

       "question": "What is hoisting in JavaScript?",
       "details": "Hoisting is the behaviour of JavaScript where all the function declarations and variable declarations are moved to the top of code block.",
       "questionType": "multi",
       "trueOrFalse": false,
       "shortAns": "It is a default behavior of JavaScript to move declarations to the top.",

       "question": "What is NaN property in JavaScript?",
       "details": "NaN property represents the \"Not-a-Number\" value. It indicates that the specified value is not a legal number. Example. \"a\" * 5 will result in NaN.",
       "questionType": "multi",

	"id": 5,
	"question": "What are the advantages of JavaScript over other web technologies?",
	"details": "JavaScript is a scripting language. It is different from Java language. It is object-based, lightweight, cross-platform translated language. It is widely used for client-side validation.",

		"id": 6,
		"question": "What is a callback?",
		"details": "Case sensitivity is a feature that helps to ensure that the same code will run on different computers. When a programmer uses case sensitivity, they must use different case for different identifiers to make sure that the code will run on different computers.",
		"questionType": "multi",
		"trueOrFalse": false,
		"shortAns": "Yes, JavaScript is a case sensitive language.",
		"tag": "JavaScript"

		"id": 7,
		"question": "Can you assign an anonymous function to a variable and pass it as an argument to another function?",
		"details": "In javascript, It is a function that has no name. These functions are declared dynamically at runtime using the function operator instead of the function declaration.",
		"questionType": "multi",
		"trueOrFalse": false,
		"shortAns": "Yes! An anonymous function can be assigned to a variable. It can also be passed as an argument to another function.",
		"tag": "JavaScript"

		"question": "What is BOM?",
		"details": "The window object provides various properties like document, history, screen, navigator, location, innerHeight, innerWidth. You can call all the functions of the window by specifying the window or directly.",
		"questionType": "multi",
		"trueOrFalse": false,
		"shortAns": "BOM stands for Browser Object Model. It provides interaction with the browser. The default object of a browser is a window.",

	{
		"id": 9,
		"question": "What does being weakly typed mean for JavaScript?",
		"details": "Strict typing is a method in programming languages that assigns each variable a data type that any assignment must adhere to. Weak typed languages, such as JavaScript, do not enforce any such rule. This means a variable can be assigned as an integer, and a string can be concatenated to it, casting the entire thing to a string.",
		"questionType": "multi",
		"trueOrFalse": false,
		"shortAns": "It is possible to declare a variable without stating what data type the variable is.",
		"tag": "JavaScript"
	},
	{
		"id": 10,
		"question": "What does the === operator mean?",
		"details": "As JavaScript is weakly typed, variables can have the same value without being the same type. For example, 10 would be equal to '10'. Using three equal signs equates both the value and the type without conversion. As the second value in our example is a string, it would fail to match against the integer.",
		"questionType": "multi",
		"trueOrFalse": false,
		"shortAns": "It is that 2 variables are the same value and type without conversion.",
		"tag": "JavaScript"
	},
	{
		"id": 11,
		"question": "What does 'this' keyword mean?",
		"details": "The keyword 'this' refers to an object, which one depends on where it is being called from. It gives reference to that object, allowing JavaScript to update the object. For example, 'this' may refer to a Person object, JavaScript will have access to properties of the object such as 'this.firstName' or functions like 'this.setHeight(180)'.",
		"questionType": "multi",
		"trueOrFalse": false,
		"shortAns": "It is an object, which object depends upon where the code is being invoked.",
