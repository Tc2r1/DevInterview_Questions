      "question": "What is a dog?",
      "details": "The dog is characterized by an upturning tail. The dog derived from an ancient, extinct wolf, and the modern grey wolf is the dog's nearest living relative.",

      "question": "Is a train characterized by a rail transport?",
      "details": "It is a form of transport consisting of a series of connected vehicles that generally run along a railroad track to transport passengers or cargo. The word train comes from the Old French trahiner, derived from the Latin trahere meaning "to pull, to draw". ",

      "question": "What is the type of data structures of queues and stacks?",
      "details": "If the queue/stack is implemented using an array it is a linear data structure. If the queue/stack is implemented using linked list it is not a linear.",
      "questionType": "multi",
      "trueOrFalse": "false",

      "question": "What is a linked-list?",
      "details": "A linked-list is a list of data-items connected with links i.e. pointers or references. Most modern high-level programming language does not provide the feature of directly accessing memory location, therefore, linked-list are not supported in them or available in form of inbuilt functions.",
      "questionType": "multi",

      "question": "What is linear data structure?",
      "details": "A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively. The idea is to reduce the space and time complexities of different tasks.",
      "questionType": "multi",
      "trueOrFalse": false,

      "question": "What is a queue?",
      "details": "A queue is a data structure that can simulate a list or stream of data. In this structure, new elements are inserted at one end, and existing elements are removed from the other end and the operations are performed in First In First Out (FIFO) order. ",
      "questionType": "multi",

      "question": "What do you understand about Postfix Expressions?",
      "details": "Postfix Expression is extremely beneficial in computing terms since it doesn’t require any grouping of sub-expressions into parenthesis or even consider operator precedence.",
      "questionType": "multi",
      "trueOrFalse": false,
      "shortAns": "Postfix Expression is an expression where operators follow the operands.",

      "question": "What is a hashmap in data structure?",
      "details": "Hashmap is a data structure that uses an implementation of a hash table data structure which allows access to data in constant time (O(1)) complexity if you have the key",
      "questionType": "multi",
      "trueOrFalse": false,
      "shortAns": "It is is an implementation of a hashtable to store a key value pair",

      "question": "What is an asymptotic analysis of an algorithm?",
      "details": "Asymptotic analysis of an algorithm defines the run-time performance as per its mathematical boundations. Asymptotic analysis helps us articulate the best case(Omega Notation, Ω), average case(Theta Notation, θ), and worst case(Big Oh Notation, Ο) performance of an algorithm",
      "questionType": "multi",
      "trueOrFalse": false,
      "shortAns": "It is a mathematical measure of the performance of an algorithm",

      "id": 10,
      "question": "What is binary search?",
      "details": "Binary search follows the divide and conquer approach in which the list is divided into two halves, and the item is compared with the middle element of the list. If the match is found then, the location of the middle element is returned. Otherwise, we search into either of the halves depending upon the result produced through the match.",
      "questionType": "multi",
