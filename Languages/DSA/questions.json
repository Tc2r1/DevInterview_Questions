      "question": "What is the type of data structures of queues and stacks?",
      "details": "If the queue/stack is implemented using an array it is a linear data structure. If the queue/stack is implemented using linked list it is not a linear.",

      "question": "What is a linked-list?",
      "details": "A linked-list is a list of data-items connected with links i.e. pointers or references. Most modern high-level programming language does not provide the feature of directly accessing memory location, therefore, linked-list are not supported in them or available in form of inbuilt functions.",

      "question": "What is linear data structure?",
      "details": "A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively. The idea is to reduce the space and time complexities of different tasks.",

      "question": "What is a queue?",
      "details": "A queue is a data structure that can simulate a list or stream of data. In this structure, new elements are inserted at one end, and existing elements are removed from the other end and the operations are performed in First In First Out (FIFO) order. ",

      "question": "What do you understand about Postfix Expressions?",
      "details": "Postfix Expression is extremely beneficial in computing terms since it doesn’t require any grouping of sub-expressions into parenthesis or even consider operator precedence.",

      "question": "What is a hashmap in data structure?",
      "details": "Hashmap is a data structure that uses an implementation of a hash table data structure which allows access to data in constant time (O(1)) complexity if you have the key",

      "question": "What is an asymptotic analysis of an algorithm?",
      "details": "Asymptotic analysis of an algorithm defines the run-time performance as per its mathematical boundations. Asymptotic analysis helps us articulate the best case(Omega Notation, Ω), average case(Theta Notation, θ), and worst case(Big Oh Notation, Ο) performance of an algorithm",

      "question": "What is binary search?",
      "details": "Binary search follows the divide and conquer approach in which the list is divided into two halves, and the item is compared with the middle element of the list. If the match is found then, the location of the middle element is returned. Otherwise, we search into either of the halves depending upon the result produced through the match.",

      "question": "What is a graph?",
      "details": "A graph is a non-linear data structure, which consists of vertices (or nodes) connected by edges (or arcs) where edges may be directed or undirected. In Computer science graphs are used to represent the flow of computation..",
      "questionType": "multi",
      "trueOrFalse": false,
      "shortAns": "A graph is a pictorial representation of a set of objects where some pairs of objects are connected by links. The interconnected objects are represented by points termed as vertices, and the links that connect the vertices are called edges.",

      "question": "How Prim's algorithm finds spanning tree?",
      "details": "Prim's algorithm to find minimum cost spanning tree (as Kruskal's algorithm) uses the greedy approach. Prim's algorithm shares a similarity with the shortest path first algorithms. Prim's algorithm, in contrast with Kruskal's algorithm, treats the nodes as a single tree and keeps on adding new nodes to the spanning tree from the given graph.",
