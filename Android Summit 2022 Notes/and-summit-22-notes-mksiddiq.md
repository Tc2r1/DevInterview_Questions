# Introduction
The Android Dev Summit '22 had the demonstration and announcement of all the new features that will come or have already been launched in the beta version of the latest android update. The livestream also targeted Modern Android Development, Multi-device and the platform updates. This was a great learning for me. I also got a lot of inspiration from the developers seeing how hard they have worked to make the developing of apps easier.

# Features
The livestream highlighted many features which included a lot from Jetpack Compose Library. Some of them included:
-Modern Android Development - Jetpack Compose
- Android App Modularization
- Expanding in Wear OS
- Android in large screens (foldables, laptops, tablets etc.)
- Privacy and Security
- Custom layouts and graphics in Compose
- Making apps faster
- New debug features
- Improved error handling
- Multi-lingual apps

These were only a few main features of the many talked about on the livestream.

# Favourite feature : Compose
The Compose Jetpack Library was the highlight for me in the whole livestream. There was a lot that a developer could do using Compose. It had made the UI experience for the user much smoother and cleaner. It also made the development of the UI much easier, beautiful and neat. Compose is also a default feature in the latest android studio. They are now using compose in Android TVs as well!
Some of the features of compose include:
- Simplified UI logic
- Easier to learn and understand the code
- Easy to use, developer-friendly
- 160 of the top 1000 apps on play store are already using compose!
- Can write dynamic and efficient apps.
and much more....

# Conclusion
I have realised as a beginner that there is still a lot to learn in android with new features coming up everyday. The Android Developers are also working very hard to make them as easy to learn as possible. With new features in Compose, app developers can now create more beautiful and user-friendly UIs and keep their apps dynamic and efficient. Overall, the Android Dev Summit helped me a lot and informed me all the new features that I needed to learn.
